            <h1>Services</h1>
            <p><img src="images/animeservice.png" alt="Crunchyroll" class="animeservice">Where can you watch anime? There are a lot of places where you can watch anime shows and movies. These include but are not limited to: VRV, Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, and Hulu. All these services are the main ones where people end up watching anime. My favorite streaming services are VRV and Crunchyroll. These two services contain a lot of content which makes it worth paying for a subscription. For instance, VRV does not only have anime shows but cartoons as well. On the other hand, Crunchyroll allows you to read manga, comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. Below you will find a breakdown of the prices and benefits for each of the common streaming services. Enjoy this information so you can watch your favorite anime and movies. </p>
