            <h1>Anime Includes Movies!</h1>
            <!-- Add IMG !-->
            <p><img src="images/cinema.gif" alt="Your Name Stars" class="cinema">Just as there are movies for normal shows, this is also the case for anime. These movies are often connected to the anime series and explain something that was not mentioned in the main show. Alternatively, they serve to extend the anime. Once an anime ends, just hope a movie is around the corner! Moreover, if these movies do not help explain events within the anime, it may also be its separate thing unrelated to the show. The examples provided below are not part of a series, they are simply movies. Although this is the case, these movies end up being good, hooking the viewer with its beautiful cinematics. The movie genre contains a long duration of cinema, neat animations, often serves as a story explaination, and more. Here are a few examples of anime movies.</p>
