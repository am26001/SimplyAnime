            <h1>What Is An Adventure-Based Anime?</h1>
            <!-- Add IMG !-->
            <p><img src="images/exploration.gif" alt="Land Exploration" class="exploration">The adventure genre in anime is about travelling and adventuring to certain places or around the world. In most adventure-based animes, the protagonist travels with a group of allies or freinds. These characters accept challenging jobs and are often rewarded for their hard work. They are willing to venture into certain places in search for treasure, exploration, defeating an enemy, or saving the world. Although the journey is difficult, the viewer learns a lot about these characters and their background. In most situations, episodes are stretched so that the viewer can experience the journey with the characters in the anime. The adventure genre contains a lot of exploration, humor, character bonding, risk and reward, immersion, and more. Here are a few examples of adventure-based animes.</p>
